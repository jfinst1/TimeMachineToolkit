# Crypto Framework

This project combines the strengths of Algebraic Curve Cryptography (ECC) and Homomorphic Encryption (HE), with optional Quantum Computing elements, to create a robust cryptographic framework.

## Structure

- **crypto/**: Core cryptographic components including elliptic curve cryptography, homomorphic encryption, and quantum operations.
- **utils/**: Utility modules for key management and data conversion.
- **tests/**: Unit tests for the core components.

## Installation

Install the required Python libraries:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
